//! @name EventManager
//! The cyber event manager tracks scheduled cyber events related to engagements.
//! During these delays, this interface allows the canceling of these
//! events to preemptively stop an engagement from progressing. Attacks and scans
//! are tracked separately, as both of these types of engagements are allowed
//! simultaneously. Furthermore, this object allows the query of which events
//! and their corresponding delay types are being managed.
//!
//! @note This class is only intended for usage with events associated with the
//! cyber engagement progression. Only a single event is ever scheduled at any
//! given time for this use case for scans or attacks.
//! Other events, such as those that might be used
//! by effects directly, are not handled nor intended to be handled by this object.
